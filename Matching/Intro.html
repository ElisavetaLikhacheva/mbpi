    <p>
        On the following screen you will see 20 scenarios.
        In each scenario you can choose between a lottery and a safe payment.
        The lottery is as follows:
        There is a 50% chance to get 10€, and a 50% chance to get nothing.

        The safe payment increases from scenario to scenario.
        Its value is 0 in the first scenario, 0.5€ in the second, 1€ in the third, and so on.
        In the last scenario, the value is 10€.
    </p>

    <p>
        The idea of this experiment is to find the point at which you are willing to switch between the lottery and the
        safe payment.
        Following this idea, the experiment comes with a feature that, once you select a safe payment or a lottery,
        automatically checks all the remaining safe payments/lotteries for you.
    </p>

    <p>Mind that you can revise your decision for as long as you want before submitting it.</p>

    <p>Please, indicate the scenario in which you switch from the lottery to the safe payment.</p>
