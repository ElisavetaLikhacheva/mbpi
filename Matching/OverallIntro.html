    This experiment consists of four parts. In the three first parts, you will be asked to make choices, in some cases involving lotteries.
    <br>
    <strong>All choices that you make in the first three parts are relevant for your bonus payoff.</strong> <br>
    The last part is a survey,
    which is not relevant for your payoff. <br>
    <strong>You will only be paid if you complete the full experiment.</strong> For this reason, please only start the experiment if you have at least 30 minutes to complete it.
